									Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that helps large language models. Before answering your question, the LLM uses RAG to search a vast external knowledge base for relevant information.
								</p>

								<p>
									With this extra knowledge, the LLM can provide more accurate and informative answers.
									RAG combines the vast knowledge of LLMs with your data, enhancing AI's ability to provide contextually rich responses.
								</p>
								<br />
								<br />RAG is extremly ueful when you need to answer question on specific domain, latest and up to date information  or use internal knowledge. Use RAG is
								<br />Domain-specific knowledge: If your assistant needs to be an expert in a specific domain, RAG can be used to integrate relevant databases or knowledge repositories to enhance its understanding.
								<br />Accuracy is crucial: If your LLM assistant needs to provide highly accurate information, especially on factual topics like science, history, or specific procedures, RAG can ensure responses are grounded in real-world knowledge.
								<br />Combating hallucinations: LLMs can sometimes make up information, called hallucination. RAG combats this by providing verifiable evidence to support the response.
								<br />Building trust: By allowing users to see where the information comes from (think footnotes!), RAG fosters trust and transparency in the assistant's responses.
